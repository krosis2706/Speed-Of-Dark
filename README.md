# Speed-Of-Dark
Something that unblocks websites for schools that are using the lightspeed system.

The plan for the Speed of Dark, is to ping websites that you attempt to get on and if it doesn't ping back then write the url down in firefoxs proxy settings to ignore. This makes it so that you can access websites the schools doesn't want you to.

it isn't hard to manually do it but I think it would be fun to automate the process!

I don't know what I'm doing and that is why this is a public repository. 
If you make changes can you please explain anything and everything to the best of your abilities it would be greatly appreciated in the name of education! 
Please and Thank you kind internet strangers.

How to unblock manually:
1. find a website that is blocked, we will use www.minecraft.net/

2. go into network settings (at the bottom of general) 

3. at the bottom where it says "No proxy for" paste the url you wish to travel



P.S. I will only be commiting things that I fully understand so that I don't get lost in my own project. 
but I promise I will learn as much as possible.
